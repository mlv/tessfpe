TESS CCD clock sequencer programs for testing.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

DolphinDance:

Simplistic CCD clocking. Start of line bias not as flat as possible.
	
Integrates in P1-IA and P2-IA. Holds charge in P2-FS.
	
Defaults to a disabled measurement chain with charge queued in P2-OR and P3-OR.

Charge injection disabled.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
UpAndRunning:

Similar to DolphinDance, but attempts to flatten bias by dummy clocking for 32 pixel cycles after a parallel to serial transfer. It uses the upper serial register as a "dummy load" for the serial drivers.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

WeHideAndSeek:

Like UpAndRunning, but with reversed parallel clocks for room temperature testing.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

BlueRondo:

Like UpAndRunning, but injects charge into the lowest "smear" row.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

UfoTofu:

Reversed parallel clocks. Attempts to flatten bias by sloshing charge back and forth in the serials for 32 pixel cycles after a parallel to serial transfer.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Lateralus:

Similar to UfoTofu. Reversed parallel clocks. UfoTofu moves charge forward/back 8 pixels two times. Lateralus moves it forward/back two pixels 8 times.

Lateralus2:

Asserts Clamp and RG during slosh for better measurement chain stability. Currently preferred reversed clocking sequence.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

TakeFive:

Similar to DolphinDance.

Charge injection enabled. It injects charge into the first five "smear rows". It does not attempt to settle the start of line ringing.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

GimmeFive:

Five equally spaced rows of charge injection.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hemiola:

Based on Lateralus2, but with forward parallel clocks. No charge injection, and operates the upper serial with all gates low all the time. Current flight candidate.
